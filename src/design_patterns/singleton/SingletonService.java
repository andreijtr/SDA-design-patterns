     * 1. create a private constructor
     * 2. declare a private static final (constant) variable of this type and assign an object instantiated using private constructor from step 1
     * 3. create a public static method called "getInstance" that returns the static variable from step 2

     * Now you have a singleton class. Great. Let put this at work.
     * Create a public method that returns a String with text "Design patterns are fun".
